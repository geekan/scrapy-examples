scrapy-examples
===============

Multifarious scrapy examples with integrated proxies and agents, which make you comfy to write a spider.

Don't use it to do anything illegal!

***

## Real spider example: doubanbook

#### Tutorial

    git clone https://github.com/geekan/scrapy-examples
    cd scrapy-examples/doubanbook
    scrapy crawl doubanbook

#### Depth

There are several depths in the spider, and the spider gets
real data from depth2.

- Depth0: The entrance is `http://book.douban.com/tag/`
- Depth1: Urls like `http://book.douban.com/tag/外国文学` from depth0
- Depth2: Urls like `http://book.douban.com/subject/1770782/` from depth1

## Avaiable Spiders

* tutorial
  * dmoz_item
  * douban_book
  * page_recorder
  * douban_tag_book
* doubanbook
* linkedin
* hrtencent
* sis
* zhihu
* alexa
  * alexa
  * alexa.cn

## Advanced

* Use `parse_with_rules` to write a spider quickly.  
  See dmoz spider for more details.

* Proxies
  * If you don't want to use proxy, just comment the proxy middleware in settings.  
  * If you want to custom it, hack `misc/proxy.py` by yourself.  

* Notice
  * Don't use `parse` as your method name, it's an inner method of CrawlSpider.

### Advanced Usage

* Run `./startproject.sh <PROJECT>` to start a new project.  
  It will automatically generate most things, the only left things are:
  * `PROJECT/PROJECT/items.py`
  * `PROJECT/PROJECT/spider/spider.py`

#### Example to hack `items.py` and `spider.py`

Hacked `items.py` with additional fields `url` and `description`:  
```
from scrapy.item import Item, Field

class exampleItem(Item):
    url = Field()
    name = Field()
    description = Field()
```

Hacked `spider.py` with start rules and css rules (here only display the class exampleSpider):  
```
class exampleSpider(CommonSpider):
    name = "dmoz"
    allowed_domains = ["dmoz.org"]
    start_urls = [
        "http://www.dmoz.com/",
    ]
    # Crawler would start on start_urls, and follow the valid urls allowed by below rules.
    rules = [
        Rule(sle(allow=["/Arts/", "/Games/"]), callback='parse', follow=True),
    ]

    css_rules = {
        '.directory-url li': {
            '__use': 'dump', # dump data directly
            '__list': True, # it's a list
            'url': 'li > a::attr(href)',
            'name': 'a::text',
            'description': 'li::text',
        }
    }

    def parse(self, response):
        info('Parse '+response.url)
        # parse_with_rules is implemented here:
        #   https://github.com/geekan/scrapy-examples/blob/master/misc/spider.py
        self.parse_with_rules(response, self.css_rules, exampleItem)
```
